What happens to your code when requirements change? This is one of the biggest challenges in software development, and there are many pitfalls. We'll look at how a single view function might evolve, with lessons learned from Django projects that have been going 15 years, in an evolving ecosystem and a growing understanding of the most effective patterns in OOP.

This is also an introduction to Luke Plant's very recent work [Django Views â€” The Right Way](https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/).
