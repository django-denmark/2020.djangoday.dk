# Program


Django Day is a full day of talks, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.

The full program was announced March 1st. You could
[submit your proposal](/cfp/) until February 16th (extended from February 2nd). A virus came and interrupted our planning, and we rescheduled the whole event from taking place on April 17th. Luckily, all speakers re-confirmed.

# Previous events

## DjangoCon Europe 2019

We originally decided that we would do another Django Day 2019 in Copenhagen.
But then we got pretty caught up in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2019 in
Copenhagen and postponed Django Day.

The event is archived here: [2019.djangocon.eu](https://2019.djangocon.eu)

## DjangoDay 2018

Django Copenhagen Day 2018 (slides etc. archived [here](https://2018.djangoday.dk/))
was a fantastic start for Django Denmark. Before this, we had smaller meetups
for many years, but as they slowed down, we decided to try an bigger
gathering.
