either to be experienced **online -or- at our venue** with safe social distancing.

Come and meet your local and excellent community and share with them.
[Tell us](/cfp/) about your idea and your contribution to make this a great day.

The physical event will accommodate 72 people, and the virtual event is unlimited. You can stream the event for free, and
we highly encourage getting a <a href="">remote package</a>.

# Program

Django Day is a full day of talks, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.

The full program was announced March 1st. You could
[submit your proposal](/cfp/) until February 16th (extended from February 2nd).

A virus came and interrupted our planning, and we rescheduled the whole event from
taking place on April 17th. Most speakers have reconfirmed, but the program is still subject to adjustments.

## Greening Django

##### Chris Adams

We're in a climate emergency, and as the world goes digital, we run the risk
from going from software eating the world, to software heating the world.

Chris Adams, from the Green Web Foundation and [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) will show how
to quantify the emissions from the digital projects you work on, and how to make
measurable differences, from optimising code, to thinking structurally about how
you spend your time as a web professional.

## Mega-Very-Cool: The story of how the MVC Pattern Was Developed

##### Nynne Just Christoffersen

We all know and love the MVC pattern. But why is it so great? Did you ever work
with a project with another worldview? Do you know what came before this
brilliant and elegant separation solution? This talk takes you through the story
of how MVC was developed and why we should really appreciate it.

## Full-Text search in Django: a journey between different approaches

##### Marco Alabruzzo

Full-Text Search is an old problem. There are many solutions: the classic SQL LIKE
statement, external search index, 3rd party SaaS, PostgreSQL’s trigram...
This talk will go through the difference between the various approaches, providing
elements to identify which one is the best for each case.

## The 101 guide to deploying Django

##### Iulia Avram

What are some good practices? Can I make a checklist to help me through the process?
Which web integration interface could I use? What are some common issues that come with each choice?
How to debug my Django app inside the container?
Could ASGI be the hero in a cape?

## Introducing iommi - your first pick for a django power cord

#### Anders Hovmöller

[iommi](http://iommi.rocks/) is a high level framework to radically accelerate building django apps. Write reusable pages and CRUD views way faster without templates and still customize every bit and end up with almost no code.

## API First Design and Django

#### Klaus Laube

Let's mess around with contracts, {over,under}fetching and Developer
eXperience when creating APIs.

When creating an API endpoint in Django, some questions are asked less frequently:
What about the contract? What about a possible overfetching
(or underfetching)? What about the
developer that is going to use the endpoint? Let's look for these
aspects when creating an API using Django.

## Realizing Relé

#### Andrew Graham-Yooll

At my workplace, our system architecture has evolved rapidly to fit our
product needs. One of those needs was the to bring reliable delivery of
user and system events throughout all our services. We adopted Google
PubSub, and eventually Open Sourced our solution,
[Relé](https://medium.com/mercadona-tech/announcing-rel%C3%A9-c2d0540af3b9).

## Contemporary Documentation

#### Juha-Matti Santala


Teams change often. People leave and people join. In addition to those changes, we tend to forget what we were thinking. That's why it's a good practice to document those thoughts, discussions and decisions into a format that doesn't lose them.

In this talk I explore ways to use tools and processes you might be familiar with - version control and project management tools - to help you document the motivation, thoughts and intents behind changes when they happen. You'll get practical tips that you can take back to your work the next day.

## Django: The No Collar Journey

#### Marco Fernandes

Do you want to know how to sell Django like the “pen” from the Wolf Of Wall Street scene? Corporates these days are always looking for the next best thing. Little did I know at the time the next best thing was going to be Django. Let me tell you how a fresh graduate changed things up when tasked with introducing new internal applications for the busy collars of today’s world, all with the help of Django.

# Previous events

## DjangoCon Europe 2019

We originally decided that we would do another Django Day 2019 in Copenhagen.
But then we got pretty caught up in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2019 in
Copenhagen and postponed Django Day.

The event is archived here: [2019.djangocon.eu](https://2019.djangocon.eu)

## DjangoDay 2018

Django Copenhagen Day 2018 (slides etc. archived [here](https://2018.djangoday.dk/))
was a fantastic start for Django Denmark. Before this, we had smaller meetups
for many years, but as they slowed down, we decided to try an bigger
gathering.
