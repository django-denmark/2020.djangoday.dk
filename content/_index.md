followed by an evening of social events.

The event will accommodate ~100 people.

# Who are we?

Django Day is brought to you by [Django Denmark](https://www.django-denmark.org/),
an association formed in 2018 with the aim of creating and supporting education
and networking activities in relation to The Django Web Framework.

## We can use your help

If you want to help us with Django Day, please send us an email to
[info@django-denmark.org](mailto:info@django-denmark.org).

# Previous events

## DjangoCon Europe 2019

We originally decided that we would do another Django Day 2019 in Copenhagen.
But then we got pretty caught up in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2019 in
Copenhagen and postponed Django Day.

The event is archived here: [2019.djangocon.eu](https://2019.djangocon.eu)

## DjangoDay 2018

Django Copenhagen Day 2018 (slides etc. archived [here](https://2018.djangoday.dk/))
was a fantastic start for Django Denmark. Before this, we had smaller meetups
for many years, but as they slowed down, we decided to try an bigger
gathering.

# Program 2020

A full day of talks will be presented here, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. And don't worry: It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.

Please standby, as we announce the full program on March 1st. You can
[submit your proposal](/cfp/) until February 16th (extended from February 2nd).
