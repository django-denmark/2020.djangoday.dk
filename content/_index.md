# Program

A full day of talks will be presented here, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. And don't worry: It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.

Please standby, as we announce the full program by March 1st. You can
[submit your proposal](/cfp/) until February 16th (extended from February 2nd).

## Greening Django

##### Chris Adams

We're in a climate emergency, and as the world goes digital, we run the risk
from going from software eating the world, to software heating the world.

Chris Adams, from the Green Web Foundation and [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) will show how
to quantify the emissions from the digital projects you work on, and how to make
measurable differences, from optimising code, to thinking structurally about how
you spend your time as a web professional.

## Mega-Very-Cool: The story of how the MVC Pattern Was Developed

##### Nynne Just Christoffersen

We all know and love the MVC pattern. But why is it so great? Did you ever work
with a project with another worldview? Do you know what came before this
brilliant and elegant separation solution? This talk takes you through the story
of how MVC was developed and why we should really appreciate it.

## Full-Text search in Django: a journey between different approaches

##### Marco Alabruzzo

Full-Text Search is an old problem. There are many solutions: the classic SQL LIKE
statement, external search index, 3rd party SaaS, PostgreSQL’s trigram...
This talk will go through the difference between the various approaches, providing
elements to identify which one is the best for each case.

## Introducing iommi - your first pick for a django power cord

# Previous events

## DjangoCon Europe 2019

We originally decided that we would do another Django Day 2019 in Copenhagen.
But then we got pretty caught up in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2019 in
Copenhagen and postponed Django Day.

The event is archived here: [2019.djangocon.eu](https://2019.djangocon.eu)

## DjangoDay 2018

Django Copenhagen Day 2018 (slides etc. archived [here](https://2018.djangoday.dk/))
was a fantastic start for Django Denmark. Before this, we had smaller meetups
for many years, but as they slowed down, we decided to try an bigger
gathering.
